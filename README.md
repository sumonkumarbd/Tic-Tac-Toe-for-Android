## Overview
The **Tic-Tac-Toe for Android** app brings the classic game to your phone, perfect for quick fun with friends. As the developer, I wanted to create a simple, engaging game thatâ€™s easy to play anywhere, keeping the charm of Tic-Tac-Toe alive with a modern Android twist.

This app features a 3x3 grid for two players, automatic win/draw detection, a reset option, and a clean design, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Features
- **Two-Player Mode**: Friends can take turns as X or O on a 3x3 grid, perfect for casual matches.
- **Win/Draw Detection**: Automatically checks for winners or ties after each move, announcing results instantly.
- **Reset Game**: Start a new match with one tap, keeping the fun going without hassle.
- **Intuitive Controls**: Tap-to-play interface makes it easy for all ages to jump in.
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean visuals focus on gameplay, with clear X and O markers.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Architecture**: MVVM for organized code
- **UI**: XML for front-end development

## How It Works
1. **Start Game**: Players choose X or O and begin on a 3x3 grid, taking turns to place their mark.
2. **Gameplay**: Tap a cell to make a move; the app alternates between players.
3. **Win Check**: After each move, the app checks for three-in-a-row or a draw, displaying the result.
4. **Reset**: Hit reset to clear the board and start a new game.
5. **Feedback**: Visual cues (e.g., highlighted winning line) show the gameâ€™s outcome.
